# DataTracks UI Components

A standardized React component library for internal enterprise web applications. Built with TypeScript, Vite, and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), this library provides production-ready, type-safe, and consistent UI components to accelerate development and ensure design consistency across projects.

> **Note:** Many foundational components and styles are based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), ensuring modern design, accessibility, and easy extensibility.

## Features

- **Enterprise Standards:** Components follow established design patterns and coding standards for consistency across projects.
- **shadcn/ui Foundation:** Built on top of shadcn/ui, providing accessible, customizable, and well-tested primitives for rapid development.
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation with comprehensive type definitions for reliable development workflow.
- **Production Ready:** Optimized components with minimal bundle impact and efficient rendering for production applications.
